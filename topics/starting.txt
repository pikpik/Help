Hello!

This is a really long introduction. The point of this is to simulate long lines. It's also supposed to be at least somewhat informative though.

So, instead of just spamming you with lots of ipsum lorem, I'll try explaining some idea I have for this.

The point of this Help program is to try to make it easier for things to get documented. This has at least two parts.

First, this can help open source project maintainers to keep their documentation up-to-date.

Second, it can reduce the barrier to entry for those in the community who wish to contribute valuable feedback and help by documenting things.

How could this be done? Well, the idea of this Help program is to achieve it by allowing documentation to be edited very easily.

The idea is that a simple set of text files and folders can be used to store documentation for individual topics or groups of related topics.

Within the text files, a very simple editing style, similar to a Readme file, could be used.

The point of this is to make the documentation system easy to use and feel very open and inclusive to editing.

To do that, it might be best to keep the formatting and editing conventions as loose, informal, and (potentially) flexible as possible, while still having some form of cohesive structure and curation.

It's gotta be easy to read and understand, but also easy for anyone to edit and contribute their changes for it.

It's a balance, but most things are and compromise might be a good thing. :)
